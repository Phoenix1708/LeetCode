# Median of two sorted arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

#### p.s the question doesn't specify the order of two array i.e. whether they both descending or ascending but most solution assumes both ascending case. Same assumption made here as I a am green hand BUT this is to mark this issue down to tackle later
